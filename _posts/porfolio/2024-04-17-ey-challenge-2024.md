# Automating Coastal Vulnerability Assessment: AI-Driven Geospatial Analysis via Building Damage Detection
## Team: Double Y (Yi Jie Wong, Yin Loon Khor, Liu Ziwei)

📄 [Technical Report](https://double-y-ey-challenge-2024.github.io/) | 💻 [Source Code](https://github.com/Double-Y-EY-Challenge-2024/EY-challenge-2024) | 📝 [Paper](https://www.techrxiv.org/users/844381/articles/1233489-automating-coastal-vulnerability-assessment-ai-driven-geospatial-analysis-via-building-damage-detection?commit=a39e0164552dc5c83a788fc8707b3f129f5b5cec)

The goal of this **[EY Challenge](https://challenge.ey.com/challenges/tropical-cyclone-damage-assessment-lrrno2xm)** is to develop a machine learning model to identify and detect “damaged” and “un-damaged” coastal infrastructure (residential and commercial buildings), which have been impacted by natural calamities such as hurricanes, cyclones, etc. Participants will be given pre- and post-cyclone satellite images of a site impacted by Hurricane Maria in 2017 and build a machine learning model, designed to detect four different objects in a satellite image of a cyclone impacted area:
1. Undamaged residential building
2. Damaged residential building
3. Undamaged commercial building
4. Damaged commercial building

If you’ve ever watched Naruto and tried mimicking hand signs in front of your mirror, then you’ll understand exactly what sparked this project.

**The Next Hokage** is a passion project that merges our love for anime and emerging tech. It’s a gesture-controlled immersive game that brings Naruto’s iconic hand signs to life. Think of it as casting Jutsu using your own hands—just like a ninja.

## 🎮 Why Build This?
The idea came from a simple observation: most Naruto games use traditional control schemes—joysticks, buttons, maybe touchscreen gestures—but none of them truly feel like Naruto. There’s a disconnect between the player and the in-universe mechanics that make the series so captivating.

That’s when we asked:
> “What if we could play a Naruto game using real hand signs—just like in the anime?”

## 🧠 The Core Idea: Jutsu via Gesture Recognition
We designed a system where players perform actual hand signs in front of a camera, and the game detects those signs to trigger in-game Jutsu. Our goal was to build something intuitive, engaging, and deeply connected to Naruto’s identity.

Key features:
- Real-time hand sign and sequence detection using a custom-trained AI model.
- Solo and PvP game modes with animated combat.
- A library of Jutsu techniques, each with its own gesture combo—like a ninja’s version of special moves.

## 🛠️ Behind the Scenes: How It Works
At the heart of the game is a pose detection model trained to recognize specific hand gestures. We built a full-stack solution:
- Input layer: Real-time hand tracking via webcam.
- AI model: Recognizes and classifies hand signs.
- Game logic: Translates gestures into attacks or defensive moves.
- Frontend UI: Stylized like a ninja scroll, with immersive feedback and animation.
- Backend: Local infrastructure handles PvP gameplay, Jutsu execution, and game state management.

## ✨ Final Thoughts
The Next Hokage was more than a school project—it was a fusion of anime nostalgia, technical experimentation, and creative ambition. For us, it’s proof that fan-driven ideas can turn into serious engineering challenges worth solving.

Projects like this remind me why we got into tech in the first place—not just to build things that work, but to build things that excite.

If you’re curious about the AI, want to collaborate, or just want to talk Naruto and tech—let’s connect.

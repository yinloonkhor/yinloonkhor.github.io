# About Me
Yin Loon Khor holds a B.Eng. (Hons.) degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR), Malaysia, awarded in 2024. He is currently pursuing Master of Artificial Intelligence at Universiti Malaya (UM), where he focuses on advancing his expertise in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and large language models (LLMs).

Previously, he worked as a graduate trainee with the DFx team at Intel Corporation, where he works on system-on-chip (SoC) and subsystem-level integration, defect resolution across multi-domain components, and automation scripting using Python.

His research interests and expertise span machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and large language models (LLMs). During his undergraduate studies, he actively pursued these areas through research and competition. He was the Champion of the IEEE Big Data Cup 2024 – Building Extraction Generalization Challenge, and one of the Top 10 Global Semi-Finalists in the 2024 EY Open Science Data Challenge. In addition, he has published two conference papers in the fields of deep learning and computer vision.

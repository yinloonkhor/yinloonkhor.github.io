# Portfolio

## Projects
1.	Coastal Vulnerability Assessment via Building Damage Detection (Repo)
- Designed an AI-driven geospatial analysis pipeline for automated coastal disaster assessment by detecting building damage from satellite imagery
- Leveraged transfer learning technique through pretraining and fine-tune model with a carefully engineered sequence using manually and self-annotated data
- Achieved 0.51 mAP (27.5% above completion threshold) and ranked 8th among the top 10 global semi-finalists in 2024 EY Open Science Data Challenge over 11,000 registrants
2.	Smart Car Plate Recognition System using Multi-Task Learning (Repo)
- Introduced a one-stage YOLO-based multi-task model that integrates both Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for enhanced vehicle identification
- Designed a custom multi-task learning framework with weighted sum approach for multiple loss functions optimisation, ensuring scalability and practicability
- Improved overall mAP and inference time by 5.56% and 78.90% compared to conventional method, respectively
- Published conference paper at IEEE EAIS 2024 and awarded gold in LKC FES FYP Poster Competition 2024
3.	Expense Tracker & Tax Filing Assistant for Freelancers (Repo)
- Developed the FastAPI backend for a full-stack web app (Vue.js, Laravel, PostgreSQL) to automate expense tracking and simplify tax filing, with the application deployed on Alibaba Cloud for scalable access
- Utilized prompt engineering with a visual language model to perform OCR, extracting structured data from receipts and classifying expenses into tax deduction categories, enabling personalized tax-saving suggestions
- Created a RAG-powered chatbot using LangChain and ChromaDB to answer complex tax questions from curated tax documents, improving user confidence in tax filing

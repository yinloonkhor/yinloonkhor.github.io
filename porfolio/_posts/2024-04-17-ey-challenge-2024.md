# Automating Coastal Vulnerability Assessment: AI-Driven Geospatial Analysis via Building Damage Detection
## Team: Double Y (Yi Jie Wong, **Yin Loon Khor**, Liu Ziwei)<br>

The goal of the [challenge](https://challenge.ey.com/challenges/tropical-cyclone-damage-assessment-lrrno2xm) is to develop a machine learning model to identify and detect “damaged” and “un-damaged” coastal infrastructure (residential and commercial buildings), which have been impacted by natural calamities such as hurricanes, cyclones, etc. Participants will be given pre- and post-cyclone satellite images of a site impacted by Hurricane Maria in 2017 and build a machine learning model, designed to detect four different objects in a satellite image of a cyclone impacted area:
1. Undamaged residential building
2. Damaged residential building
3. Undamaged commercial building
4. Damaged commercial building

# Multi-Task YOLO for Vehicle Colour Recognition and Automatic License Plate Recognition
üíª [Source Code](https://github.com/yinloonkhor/YOLOv8-multi-detection-head/tree/main) | üìù [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10570013)

This project is developed for multi-task learning using YOLOv8n backbone with three detection heads specifically for OCR, LP detection and VCR. Our solution introduces a novel one-stage YOLO-based multi-task model for ALPR. It incorporates additional object detection heads onto the YOLO backbone, allowing for efficient real-time detection.

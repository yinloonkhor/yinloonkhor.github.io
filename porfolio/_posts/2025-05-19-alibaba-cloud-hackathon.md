SmarTax is an AI-powered web application developed as part of the **[Alibaba Cloud AI Hackathon 2025](https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/developer/malaysia-ai-hackathon?_p_lc=1)**, aimed at solving a major pain point for freelancers and gig workers: **the complexity of tax filing**. Many freelancers struggle with tax compliance due to scattered financial records, confusing tax forms, and unclear deduction rules. Without access to professional accounting services or intelligent tools, they risk **underreporting or overpaying** â€” which can lead to financial losses or legal issues.

SmarTax was designed to **simplify and streamline the entire tax preparation process**. The application automatically tracks income and expenses, intelligently categorizes transactions according to tax rules, and offers **personalized deduction suggestions** â€” all tailored for users without an accounting background.

What makes SmarTax stand out is its combination of powerful features packed into a clean, intuitive user experience. Users can extract data from receipts and PDFs using built-in OCR, interact with a tax-focused AI chatbot for quick answers, and receive actionable insights to maximize tax savings. By integrating domain expertise with modern AI tooling, SmarTax helps make tax filing less stressful and more accurate.

The system is built with a Vue.js frontend and a Laravel + FastAPI backend, hosted on Alibaba Cloud infrastructure (ECS and RDS). It also leverages LLMs and OCR for document understanding and intelligent assistance.
